1. specificity is achieved by multiple transcription factors each with "weak" affinity acting synergistically to induce expression of a specific gene
2. transcription factors can open chromatin by blocking histone-reattachment, recruiting HATs and chromatin remodelling complexes (SWI/SNF)
3. The stripe 2 regulatory segment has binding sites for 4 transcription factors and is activated when giant/krüppel are absent but bicoid and/or hunchback are present
4. it induces its own expression, either directly or via the expression of other transcription factors that activate its expression
5. insert plasmids with ktf4, oct4 and sox2 that induce a pluripotent stem cell stage
6. DNA methylation signals repression and is put on closed/heterochromatin
7. DNA methylation can both repress and activate gene-expression depending on which sequence is methylated (e.g. methylation of insulator activates)
8. The x chromosome is silenced by Xist which recruits various repressor proteins to close down and compact the x chromosome.
9. CpG islands are regions of the chromosome that are actively expressed or important for organism function such that they aren't lost by mutation
10. A cell memory is persistent state induced by molecular factors such as auto-expressing transcription factors or inherited chromatin and DNA modifications
