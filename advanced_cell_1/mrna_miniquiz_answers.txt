1. RNA pol II makes mRNA
2. TFIID which contains TBP (tata binding protein) binds to tata box
3. specificity is achieved by multiple weak interactions of specific transcription factors with affinity for the promoter and enhancers and proteins bound to these, cooperative binding
4. snRNPs bind to the sequences, base pairing by different U snRNAs, recruited by RNA pol II
5. specificity is achieved through differential affinity for different splite sites
6. RNA splicing takes place as RNA is being synthesized by RNA pol II and EJC are attached
7. poly A tail attachment by PAP
8. only correctly capped, and poly A'd mRNA with appropriate proteins attached get exported to cytoplasm, EJC, poly A binding proteins etc.
